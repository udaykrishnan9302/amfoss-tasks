1.Why must we choose you?

I am really intrested in technology more importantly interested in learning new ideas and creating things of my own.I have never been much of an athletic person,I have always been one of those people who spent more time in the computer labs than in the playground.I love coding(though not really great at it) and i have no hesitation in sitting infront of the screen for hours just to look for that one bug which is causing problems(which is a huge nightmare for coders)

2.What is your plan for the next 6 months?

I plan on getting better at coding and create things of my own, and hopefully gain some weight and hit the gym(i am 179cm and barely 48 kg)

3.How would you contribute back to the club?

by helping out fellow coders and actively participate in competitions,workshops etc and work on new projects

4.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

To be honest, a lot of the tasks are pretty difficult even for someone who has learned basic coding in the past but i guess this way you relly find out who are interested
