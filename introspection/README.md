## 1.Why must we choose you?

I have always been intrested in tech stuffs and more importantly interested in learning new ideas and creating things of my own.I have never been much of an athletic person,I have always been one of those people who spent more time in the computer labs than in the playground.I love coding(though not really great at it) and i have no hesitation in sitting infront of the screen for hours just to look for that one bug which is causing problems(which is a huge nightmare)

## 2.What is your plan for the next 6 months?

I plan on getting better at coding and create things of my own, and hopefully gain some weight and hit the gym(i am 180cm and barely 48 kg)

## 3.How would you contribute back to the club?

by helping out fellow coders and actively participate in workshops and other discussions, work on new projects and hopefully also try my hands on competitions

## 4.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

To be honest, a lot of the tasks are pretty difficult even for someone who has learned basic coding in the past but i guess this way you really find out who are interested in it.
most of the tasks are not the kind that would just reveal the answer from a simple google search, you really have to put in the effort and try to learn the ways to solve the challenges and i guess that was a pretty good experience
