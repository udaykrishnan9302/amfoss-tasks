## Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]
I followed a walkthrough so most of it was easy but i did end up facing one problem....apparantly some of the laptops like mine won't go into the bios setting through the F-keys, so i searched for some time and found that i could access it through "change advanced startup options" in the windows settings, after that it was cakewalk
